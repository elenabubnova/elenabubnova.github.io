				<h3>Innovation Labs BMC subbrand</h3>
				<p>
					The Laboratory incubates and accelerates innovative ideas in a startup mode at BMC using small
					experiments that support an innovation mindset and entrepreneurship unshackled by legacy constraints
					or immediate operational considerations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Part of the strategy was to hire top talented engineers and data scientists. The BMC for those
					people is reliable, but a 40-year-old company. The company is innovative and keeps pace with the
					times, and the new brand should support that idea.
				</p>

				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<p>
					The engineers are a specific audience with their own visual code language. The idea was focused on a
					collaborative space where people can think outside the box.
				</p>
				<p>
					The logotype is representing brackets from code with a combination of the actual floor plan of that
					space and an open line that acts as an open door from all limitations.

				<h3>Web Page</h3>
				<p>
					The concept is implemented in dark colors, connecting to the natively integrated development
					environment for developers. The images are designed as a collage from photography and elements that
					resemble a constructor or kit in an engineer’s hands.

				<h3>Social media</h3>
				<p>
					The part of the campaign was to create a look and feel for the campaign on social media (primarily
					LinkedIn) to attract specialists to the company.

				<h3>Advertising</h3>
				<p>
					To catch the attention of professionals, we needed to speak in their language—literally. So we used
					Python, JavaScript, HTML in this campaign and played in charades. Some messages were kept simple for
					non-techy stuff.

				<h3>Interior</h3>
				<p>
					The primary goal of the interior space of the Innovation Labs is to create a collaborative space
					where people can interact and be inspired. Details of the interior should contain brand colors and
					elements throughout the space. Motivational messages and signages should be included to enhance
					creativity and innovation.

				<h3>Brand Guideline</h3>

					Since a lot of development was handed over to vendors to BMC offices worldwide on-site, it was
					important to create a Guideline to keep consistency across the company.
