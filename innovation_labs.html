				The Laboratory incubates and accelerates innovative ideas in a startup mode at BMC using small
				experiments that support an innovation mindset and entrepreneurship unshackled by legacy constraints
				or immediate operational considerations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of the strategy was to hire top talented engineers and data scientists. The BMC for those
				people is reliable, but a 40-year-old company. The company is innovative and keeps pace with the
				times, and the new brand should support that idea.

				The engineers are a specific audience with their own visual code language. The idea was focused on a

			<p>
				The logotype is representing brackets from code with a combination of the actual floor plan of that
				space and an open line that acts as an open door from all limitations.

				To catch the attention of professionals, we needed to speak in their languageâ€”literally. So we used

				non-techy stuff.
