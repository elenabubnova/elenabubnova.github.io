				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Accelerate BMC's transformation and reputation as a premier provider of SaaS solutions by
					producing web experiences that are compelling, customer-centric, easy to understand,
					leverage innovative design patterns and interactivity, and support a long-term customer
					relationship.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-6">
				<h3>Stretch goals:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Non-paid form page conversion rate: 35% (75% increase from 2022)
					</li>
					<li>
						Paid form page conversion rate: 9% (50% increases from 2022)

				<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>Research methods:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Web analytics (Data, Heatmaps, Recordings)
					</li>
					<li>
						Secondary research
					</li>
					<li>
						Interview with customer
					</li>
					<li>
						Competitive Analysis
					</li>
					<li>
						Usability testing
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The most valuable information we received during the interview session. The
					“Practitioner” persona really didn't use the website as a source of truth and went
					straight to the Support or Documentation section. The “Evaluator” persona prefers to
					trust other resources such as Gartner or Forester. Both the language and perception of
					the page felt “too marketing” and far from their needs.</p>

				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>We carefully reviewed product pages from different companies, including well-known brands
					and direct SaaS competitors. Our analysis included aspects such as messaging, the count
					of CTAs, the presence of human photographs, and more. Additionally, we studied organic
					search traffic, page authority score, and top keywords to compare the performance of
					these product pages on Google with our own. This research provided us with insights to
					establish a basis for structuring product page design and messaging.</p>

				<h3>Persona</h3>
				<p>Based on the research we created 2 personas: Functional or Practitioner (Manager,
					Technical) who evaluate this product and make preparation for the decision maker —
					Strategic leader (IT Ops Directors, VPs), Second Persona.</p>
				<p>We designed 2 different journeys and planned to trigger Cookie to identify Persona and
					personalize content relevant to their specific needs. During the discussion, there was a
					decision to keep the flow for both on the same page. This means there will be 2 types of
					content and messaging.</p>

				<h3>Wireframe</h3>
				<p>We went through the ideation process and many iterations and finally packed it into the
					wireframe. My main idea was to convert the language to actionable that resonated with
					user flow. Check, try, integrate, learn more, decide. I built sectioning based on that
					flow.</p>
				<p>I also provided direction and handed it off to Creative Service who was responsible for
					the visual part of this project.</p>

				<h3>Feedback</h3>
				<p>“The overall design is amazing, it is very interactive and easy to use... it looks just
					like a website should look for these kinds of products.”​</p>
				<p>“The content spread on the website was very good. A lot of relevant information is
					presented in a crisp wording.”​</p>
				<p>“I like the UI/UX. It was very easy on the eyes. It made it easier to focus on the screen
					and be able to navigate through all the different endpoints.”​</p>
				<p>“Very professional and a wealth of information is available.”</p>
