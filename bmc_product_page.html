				<p>Research methods:</p>

					Web analytics (Data, Heatmaps, Recordings)

					Secondary research

				<li>
					Interview with customer
				</li>

			<p>The most valuable information we received during the interview session. The
				“Practitioner” persona really didn't use the website as a source of truth and went
				straight to the Support or Documentation section. The “Evaluator” persona prefers to
				trust other resources such as Gartner or Forester. Both the language and perception of
				the page felt “too marketing” and far from their needs.</p>

			<h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<p>We carefully reviewed product pages from different companies, including well-known brands
				and direct SaaS competitors. Our analysis included aspects such as messaging, the count
				of CTAs, the presence of human photographs, and more. Additionally, we studied organic
				search traffic, page authority score, and top keywords to compare the performance of
				these product pages on Google with our own. This research provided us with insights to
				establish a basis for structuring product page design and messaging.</p>

				<p>Based on the research we created 2 personas: Functional or Practitioner (Manager,
					Technical) who evaluate this product and make preparation for the decision maker —
					Strategic leader (IT Ops Directors, VPs), Second Persona.</p>
				<p>We designed 2 different journeys and planned to trigger Cookie to identify Persona and
					personalize content relevant to their specific needs. During the discussion, there was a
					decision to keep the flow for both on the same page. This means there will be 2 types of
					content and messaging.</p>

			<h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Wireframe</h3>
			<p>We went through the ideation process and many iterations and finally packed it into the
				wireframe. My main idea was to convert the language to actionable that resonated with
				user flow. Check, try, integrate, learn more, decide. I built sectioning based on that
				flow.</p>
			<p>I also provided direction and handed it off to Creative Service who was responsible for
				the visual part of this project.</p>
